2. Open the Package Manager Console window. (View > Other Windows > Package Manager Console)
3. In the Default Project dropdown, select JPRSC.HRIS.
4. On the Solution Explorer, right click on JPRSC.HRIS.WebApp > Set as StartUp Project.
5. Back in the Package Manager Console window, click on PM>
6. Type Update-Database and press Enter.
7. Some text will appear on the Package Manager Console window. If all you see is white text, that's good. Any red text indicates an error. In either case, the PM> prompt will eventually reappear. Contact me in case of any error.
